I developed an Android application to improve my knowledge of mobile development and to learn Java and object-oriented programming.

Here are some key features of the application:

- Singleton Pattern: I used the Singleton pattern to ensure certain classes have only one instance.
- Data Models: I created data models, which helped me understand data structures better.
- Data Searching: I integrated Google Books APIs to search for data by sending API requests.
- Database Management: I set up a database and tables using SQLiteOpenHelper.

This project helped me learn and practice mobile development, Java programming, and working with RESTful APIs and databases. The application allows you to add categories to organize and sort books. Simply type the category name in the search bar, and if itâ€™s not already in the list, you can click the "Add Category" button to include it; otherwise, the button won't appear.After adding categories, you can add books either by typing manually or by searching through the Google Books API. Once books are added to a category, a list of authors will automatically appear. You can then find your books by using the categories list or the authors list.
